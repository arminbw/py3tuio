# py3tuio

py3tuio is a very basic, crude and compact implementation of a TUIO 1.x server written in Python 3 using pyliblo. It is restricted to 2D surfaces and does not distinguish between different clients.

â€“ Armin, March 6th, 2012

## Requirements
The TUIO protocol is based on OSC. [liblo](http://liblo.sourceforge.net/) is a popular and lightweight OSC implementation. [Pyliblo](https://github.com/dsacre/pyliblo) is a Python wrapper for liblo.
To use py3tuio in your project, install liblo first, then pyliblo.

## Basic use (demo)
Type ```python3 py3tuio.py``` in your terminal.
Get a [TUIO simulator](http://www.tuio.org/?software). Try [TuioPad](https://code.google.com/p/tuiopad/) if you want to capture the data from iOS or Android devices.
